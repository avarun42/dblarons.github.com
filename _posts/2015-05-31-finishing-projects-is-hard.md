title: "Finishing Projects is Hard"
comments: True

Finishing side projects is hard. Actually, completing anything is hard, not
only software. But I'll focus on the software case; otherwise, this post would
be long enough to be published as a self help book, and I probably wouldn't
finish that.

This spring, as summer crept towards me (or perhaps I towards it), I envisioned
reclaiming all of the free coding time that I've relished during previous
summers. Time that I have previously used to tackle tutorials, build my first
iPhone game, try out new frameworks, and learn unusual languages, all without
the nasty obligation of homework. Summer is marvelous.

But as I took a second, closer look at my imminent freedom, I realized that
this summer would necessarily be different. All of the exciting projects that I
worked on this school year, last summer, even the one before; well, not all of
those projects are finished. Even worse, some of them need to be. And to top it
all off, most of them aren't exciting to me anymore.

Somewhere in this fog of doom and gloom, there lies a new skill for me to
acquire: The focus to finish a side project.

This is no easy feat. Tying your half finished, hacked together, once exciting
monthlong project up with a complete feature set and pretty bow (aka README.md)
can be agonizing. All that refactoring, and incessant, prescribed bug
testing... the horror! And just to release a few thousand lines of code? No
thanks.

them well."

Teddy isn't my favorite historical character, but in this case, he's right.
Leaving [unfinished projects lying
around](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/)[1] is
accepting defeat.

A few of my own projects that are still lying around: Sudz, the aforementioned iPhone
game from last summer... not released; Attrition, the previously blogged about
machine learning project... not learning yet; the shell I wrote in Haskell... buggy
and disorganized; Dockerizing the VandyApps forum... you get the picture.

And there are so many more areas outside of personal projects that I wish I had
made more progress on. From [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) to
[SmashTheStack](http://smashthestack.org/), all of these little ventures into
massive time commitments give me the ghastly feeling that I haven't finished
anything in the last year.

But here's what I realized.

*Nothing is wrong with leaving some things incomplete.*

Imagine for a moment that I set out to finish every ideated feature of each of
the aforementioned projects, ventured through even a quarter of Project Euler,
and hacked into every level of only the IO portion of SmashTheStack. A liberal
estimate would guage that undertaking at a year of unadulterated work – the
pessimist would prescribe more.

And guess what? I wouldn't have any fun in my free time. That is a no-good
solution.

With that synopsis in mind, it's tempting to abandon all of my projects and
relieve myself of the stress of so many unfinished ideas. Start anew. Seek new
ventures.

*Wrong.*

The lesson of summer 2015 is a compromise: Some projects are worth finishing
outright, some must be set aside in their current state, and for most, I must
settle on *finishing* a project with drastically reduced scope.

In the first category falls Sudz, the iPhone game. I made a commitment to
finish the game, with all of its features, and I will stick to that commitment.
It will be tough to finish, but it will be finished. Similarly with the
VandyApps forum.

In the second group is all of those little ideas I've spent a day or two on,
but never completely hammered out. Project Euler and SmashTheStack are in this
category for the moment. I will return to them at some point. Maybe on a lazy
Sunday like this one, but I must accept that they will likely never be
finished.

Most everything else exists in the third category. In fact, most side projects
for all programmers begin must eventually fall into this category. Demanding that
every ideated feature be included in the final release is a recipe for
disaster. Isn't it ironic that in a business setting, we programmers we are
often the first ones to carefully restrict the scope of a project; yet, in our
own creative work, we easily fall for the same ruse? Perhaps we should take
some of our own advice and be more careful with our commitments.

This summer *is* going to be a summer for finishing things – just not
everything. Some projects will be nicely wrapped up to be shown off on
Github, while others will lie in waste, never to be seen again. Fortunately,
only I know what was released and what was left behind.
