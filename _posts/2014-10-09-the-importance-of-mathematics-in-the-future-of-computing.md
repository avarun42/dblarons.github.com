title: "The Importance of Mathematics in the Future of Computing"
---


As I look back on the last ten years of technological progress, I am stricken by the number of breakthrough technologies that lie in the intersection of mathematics and computer science. Of course, this isn't to say that other computer science achievements were orthogonal to mathematics--after all, computer science is, in reality, a field of applied mathematics--only that the developments that combine purely mathematical fields like graph theory and statistics with the unrivaled computing power of the 21st century are unique. 

In the same way that living matter and chemistry allow humans to make decisions, be creative, learn, and understand, silicon and electricity empower the computer. We may not understand how to recreate our own intelligence, but we certainly understand the binary simplicity of our semi-intelligent creations. But what role will mathematics play in the future of computing? My guess is that it will be larger than ever.

Five years ago, the only companies invested in hiring mathematically-inclined computer scientists and mathematicians were Google, Amazon, the NSA, and a select few other large, well-funded companies. Only a few years ago, starting a company that made heavy use of applied mathematics was impractical. Today, the landscape has changed. Open source machine learning libraries have made basic machine learning applications available to the hobbyist, the college start-up founder, and the aspiring engineer. 

Where will this trend head? While I cannot say for sure, my guess is that the prominence of mathematicians and mathematics in computer science will only grow. Machine learning and neural networks are only the beginning. These fields will undoubtedly grow, with more specific subfields being developed over time, as is already happening.

But there's a problem. The mathematics currently used for computer science AI applications is inelegant. While we are currently satisfied with simplistic Bayesian models applied to massive quantities of data, that will not remain the case much longer. In the past, quality data in high quantities was hard to come by. Today, data is no longer the limiting factor; but soon, mathematics may be.

The best thing a university-bound or enrolled computer science student can do is develop a strong background in mathematics. Computer science with a heavy dose of mathematics is the next ten years of computing. We may not be able to make human-intelligent computers, but we can certainly create Martian-intelligent computers.
