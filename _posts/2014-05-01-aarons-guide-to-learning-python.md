## Python

### TL;DR;

Learn Python with [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.com) and [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), but only start on codecademy after you have finished ~20 lpthw tutorials. Use Sublime Text 2 as your text editor. Make a website using Flask if that interests you, but most importantly just work on whatever keeps you coding. I'm always happy to answer questions.

### The Game Plan

Python ([learnpythonthehardway.com](http://learnpythonthehardway.com) & [codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com))

I recommend starting with Python. The language is easy to pick up, and introduces you to concepts that are fundamental to (almost) every programming language you will come across in the future.

To start learning Python, I recommend reading Zed Shaw's book at [learnpythonthehardway.com](http://learnpythonthehardway.com). The web version of the book is free. I recommend doing a few exercises a day and making sure you type all the code out. The first several exercises will be ridiculously easy for you. Don't worry, they get harder. Zed Shaw, the author, is a brilliant guy who is well respected (though sometimes controversial) in the CS community.

After you make it through a bunch of those tutorials (say, 15-20), take a look at the Python tutorials at codecademy.com. They move faster and teach less, which is why you should start with lpthw, but they explain some concepts better than Zed does. After around lesson 20 in lpthw I alternated between Codecademy and lpthw.

When learning any programming language, the best way to learn by far is to work on a project you are interested in. Python is pretty versatile language so you could make anything from a web site to a text based game to a program that compares the market values of companies. Basically I just like to have a project to work on that I'm interested in to apply the skills I learn in the tutorials. Plus, the project will take you outside the scope of the tutorials and will get you familiar with googling stuff that you don't know how to do, using the Python documentation, and reading other peoples' questions on StackOverflow.

## Tools

### Sublime Text 2

([Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2))

Download and use Sublime Text 2 as your text editor. It will be your most important tool as you learn to program. Just click cancel or whatever when the little box pops up that asks you to get a license. You don't have to buy a license... they just like to bug people about it. Try dropping a folder from Finder on your Mac into a Sublime Text 2 window.

## Miscellaneous

### Making Websites with Flask

If you want to make a webapp, check out [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Flask is a slim web-server written in Python.
